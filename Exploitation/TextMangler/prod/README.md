#TextMangler

##Purpose
We just fired our lead sysadmin for watching porn on the job.  Turns out, people don't like when they get fired.  Turns out, when people get fired, they like to mess with things.  The sysadmin "encrypted" the password for the entire domain!!!!  It's your job to get it back, or you're fired too.  

Here are a few things that were left in his home folder.

1. README.md
    - This file
2. TextMangler.go
    - Some program that our ex-sysadmin used to encrypt the password.
3. output.txt.tar.gz
    - So, I lied.  This actually isn't in the directory.  Turns out, we needed our old sysadmin to make it available to you, but like we said, that old pervert was fired, so it's on Google Drive.  That's good, right?  The output of the program is wrapped up in a tar ball for you.  This can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_AQp5s_S-khR000b2MzQ1daWEE/view?usp=sharing).  Just so you know, the file is 1.2GB.

##Notes
We know that the password will be in the following format.

ISTS-AAAA-####

Where 'A' is any uppercase or lowercase alphabetic character.

Where '#' is any digit from 0 - 9
