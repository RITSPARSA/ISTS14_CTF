#TextMangler

##Purpose
We just fired our lead sysadmin for watching porn on the job.  Turns out, people don't like when they get fired.  Turns out, when people get fired, they like to mess with things.  The sysadmin "encrypted" the password for the entire domain!!!!  It's your job to get it back, or you're fired too.  

Here are a few things that were left in his home folder.
1.) README.md
    - This file
2.) TextMangler.go
    - Some program that our ex-sysadmin used to encrypt the password.
3.) output.txt.tar.gz
    - The output of the program wrapped up in a tar ball for you.

##Notes
We know that the password will be in the following format.

ISTS-AAAA-####

Where 'A' is any uppercase or lowercase alphabetic character.
Where '#' is any digit from 0 - 9
