### TRUST NO ONE
* All these IDS solutions are probably backdoored. You're gonna have to roll your own...
* Requirements to trigger an "alert" on:
    * When more than 2 users are logged into a machine.
    * Remote reporting mechanism (e-mail, make your screen flash, $something_creative).
    * Include a list of running services into this report as well.

* Bonus points
    * Create a rule syntax to allow your IDS to be exanded upon (+50 pts)
